# React Notes Application

## Overview
This is a beginner-level React application designed to facilitate note-taking functionalities for users. Users can create, save, delete, and search notes easily through an intuitive user interface.

## Functional Requirements
### Note Creation:
- Users can create new notes by providing a title and content through a simple form or input fields.

### Note Display:
- A list of notes is displayed on the UI, visually represented as boxes containing titles and content.

### Note Saving:
- A "Save" button allows users to save their written notes, which become visible on the UI after saving.

### Note Deletion:
- Each note box includes a delete icon or button. Clicking it removes the corresponding note from the UI.

### Note Searching:
- Users can search for specific notes using a search box. The search functionality filters notes in real-time based on the entered query.

## Technical Considerations
### React Components:
- Create distinct React components for different sections, such as note form, note list, and search bar.

### State Management:
- Utilize React state to manage dynamic content like notes and search queries.

### Event Handling:
- Implement event handlers for actions like saving and deleting notes.

### Local Storage:
- Consider using local storage to persist user notes across page refreshes.

### Routing (Optional):
- Advanced implementations may include routing to segregate views like home, notes, and search.

## Submission Guidelines
### GitHub Repository:
- Create a public GitHub repository for the project.

### Readme File:
- Include a detailed readme with instructions on running the project locally and an overview of its features.

### Code Structure:
- Organize code into clear and concise components, using comments for clarity.

### Styling:
- Apply consistent and organized styling, either through CSS or a styling library like styled-components.

### Deployment:
- Deploy the application using platforms like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.
